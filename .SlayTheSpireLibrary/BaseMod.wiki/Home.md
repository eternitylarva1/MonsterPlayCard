# Welcome to the BaseMod wiki！

This wiki is designed as a place for players using mods to look up install steps/guides and for modders to read up on the BaseMod modding API and look at some code examples of how to add content to the game.

## What is BaseMod?

BaseMod is a modding API for Slay The Spire that allows for modders to more easily hook into the functionality of the base game without having to go through the tedious process of creating lots of bytecode patches. 

It supports things like:
1. Adding custom relics
1. Adding custom cards (with entirely new card colors)
1. Adding custom player classes
1. Adding custom potions
1. Adding custom events
1. Adding custom monsters

Future plans are to expand this API to encompass even more parts of the game .

There are currently hooks to deal with:
1. Card draw
2. Card exhaust
3. Many different parts of the game's execution like post-battle, pre-game-start, etc...

Take a look around the wiki to learn the specifics of exactly what BaseMod has to offer.
